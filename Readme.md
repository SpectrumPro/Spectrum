## Spectrum: The Modular DMX Control System

Spectrum is a DMX control system that’s simple to use but packed with power. With its visual, modular interface, you can build all kinds of complex lighting setups without breaking a sweat.

The idea for Spectrum came from frustration: DMX software is either too expensive or too rigid. So, I decided to make my own! Spectrum is a fully modular DMX controller built in Godot, and it’s here to give you the control and flexibility you’ve been looking for.
