## Spectrum: The Modular DMX Control System

Welcome to Spectrum, a powerful and intuitive DMX control system designed for everyone. Spectrum allows you to create complex lighting setups through a visual and fully modular interface.

Spectrum arose from the absence of DMX control programs offering a fully modular interface. Disheartened by the high prices, or lack of modularity in existing software options, I embarked on creating Spectrum. It's a fully modular DMX controller built in the Godot engine, utilizing the Model-View-Controller system. This design facilitates extremely easy customization of the software to suit individual needs.

The user interface of Spectrum utilizes dockable panels extensively. Panels serve as the primary means of interaction within Spectrum, encompassing various UI components. These range from straightforward menus like the settings menu to fully customizable workspaces, enabling users to craft virtual consoles complete with sliders, buttons, and additional panels. In Spectrum, panels can be positioned within the main tab bar, docked to any side (top, bottom, left, or right) of the application, or utilized as separate windows.

## Development

Currently, Spectrum is in the early stages of development, which translates to significant instability. This instability primarily stems from the transition from the old development test codebase to the new Model-View-Controller based system.
